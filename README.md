Package `arm` implements an ARMv8 (aarch64) instruction assembler in Go, for runtime or ahead-of-time generation of executable code.

This library is mostly adapted from the [CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs](https://github.com/CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs) (Rust) project.

Package documentation is available at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/wdamron/arm)

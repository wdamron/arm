# Instruction Reference
<!-- Markdown generated by gen/inst/inst.go; DO NOT EDIT. -->

The following list includes all supported instructions in alphabetical order, with a list of possible
encodings for each instruction.

Instructions encodings may include constraints indicating allowed register numbers, immediate ranges,
and immediate alignment. Where a constraint indicates a right shift, the immediate value is shifted
during encoding but the provided argument should not be shifted beforehand; the shift amount indicates
the required alignment for the provided argument.
